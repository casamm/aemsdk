Article
=======

1. Create
    version:    8619
    contentUrl: 8619

2. Upload Image
       image metadata returned, no change in version or contentUrl

3. Update
    appending image data to metadata, version changes because of metadata change
    version:    9381 (change)
    contentUrl: 9381

4. Seal
    contents are moved to a new bucket changing contentUrl, and since metadata needs to be updated so metadata version changes too
    version:    9659 (change)
    contentUrl: 9639 (change)

5. .article file uploaded
    contents are moved to a new bucket, workflowId is returned to track the progress

6. Get article metadata
   Once upload is finished, content is moved to a new bucket changing contentUrl, and changes metadata to change the version as well.
   version:     5411 (change)
   contentUrl:  5391 (change)

7. A second get article metadata
    reveals the change in isPublishable property from false to true, hence bumping up the version
   version:     5586 (change)
   contentUrl:  5391

8. Publish
    first publish, article status is checked, index is 1 (status[1].eventType),
    re-publish after preflight actually, article status is checked, index is different (status[2].eventType, the preflight entry changed the indexes.
    It's best to check aspect. The values of aspects are "ingestion", "publishing" and "preview".

9. Track progress

10. get article metadata
        after it's published, version and contentUrl stays the same.
    version:    5586
    contentUrl: 5391

11. Preflight doesn't change any version or contentUrl.
    Both article (status[2].eventType) and publication level (status[0].eventType statuses are checked for success


Status of Article Upload
========================


1. PreCheck - Status call on article before upload
    a. ensure that subAspect of all statuses are null

2. Upload Article -> workflowId is returned.

   Status ->
    aspect:     ingestion
    eventType:  progress                                                    success
    subAspect:  Started     Received    Extracted   Validated   Uploaded    Sealed
    numerator:  1           2               3           4           5           6
    denominator:6           6               6           6           6           6

    Started:    (1/6) Started the process to accept the zip file
    Received:   (2/6) Received article zip file
    Validated:  (4/6) Validated the manifest and compared it to the contents of the zip successfully
    Uploaded:   (5/6) Uploaded the contents of the article to the Producer Service
    Sealed:     (6/6) Sealed the contents of the article with the Producer Service

    [ingestion]

P.S. After Ingestion uploaded is when isPublishable property gets updated. See 7 above.

3. Preflight

    Status (new entry push - end of array)

    aspect:     preview
    eventType:  progress    success
    subAspect:  null        null

    numerator and denominator are null
    [ingestion, preview]

P.S. publication status is checked as well (new entry unshift - beginning of array [preview, publishing])

4. Publish

    Status (new entry push - end of array)

    aspect:     publishing
    eventType:  progress    success
    subAspect:  null        null
    numerator:  null
    denominator:null

    [ingestion, preview, publish]


Extra Attempts:

A. Preflight

    Status (Only publication was checked for it's status because article was published already I guess)
    Like always publication status entry was unshifted into status array (beginning of the array)

    aspect:     preview
    eventType:  progress    success
    [preview, publishing]

B. Unpublish

    Status of article was checked

    one status call only, (no status was added or removed)
    aspects remained to "ingestion" and "preview" only both with success eventType
    [ingestion, preview]

C. Publish

    Status of article was checked

    publishing aspect got added with from progress to success
    [ingestion, preview, publishing]

D. Preflight

    Status of article was checked

    publishing aspect was removed from statuses array,

    aspect preview was the first item in the list, and eventType went from progress to success.

    here it's concluded the order of statuses array can't be predicted, so a loop is required to iterate through types of aspects.
    [preview, publishing]

E. Unpublish

   Status of article was checked

   aspect: publishing aspect was removed, only ingestion and preview.
   [ingestion, preview]

F. Preflight

   aspect: preview went from progress to success

   [preivew, publishing]

G. Publish

    aspect: publishing went from progress to success
    [ingestion, preview, publishing]


Point:
    if aspect is publish, ingestion, preview -> normal routine

    if aspect is unpublish
    if call was article.unpublish, then set the aspect to unpublish and then check in status if aspect was unpublish,
    then loop through entries and ensure the publish aspect is not there and then notify observer, otherwise do nothing.

    if aspect is not defined, eject.
